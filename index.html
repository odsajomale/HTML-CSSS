    <h1>Have you ever made a pizza from scratch? </h1>
    <h2>Yeah, but have you really thought about it? </h2>
    <h3> Like, how if you put the sauce on first, before you make the base it doesn't really work?</h3>
<h4> Or, if you put the cheese on the sauce it's messed up too</h4>
 <!-- add some copy here-->
<p> Making a pizza is similar to coding. There are certain things we have to do first. Like making the base, letting it rise, mould the base out, add the sauce, add the toppings, add the cheese, bake, and cut and serve. Not all pizzas end up the same, but they do start out in the same way as long as you follow the order correctly. You can have everything you need to make different pizzas using the same base structure that it set up before hand.</p>

<h6> The toppings are different, they change for every occasion and taste. There is no order to toppings. So we list them like this.</h6>

<ul>
<li>pepperoni</li>
<li>olives</li> 
<li>peppers (never green)</li>
<li>mushrooms</li> 
<li>onions</li>
<li>jalapenos</li>
<li>pineapple (only if you are crazy)</li>
<li>bacon</li>
</ul>
